title: Last Weekly Blog Post

Well, it's the last blog post! The final exam was pretty tough, but I got what I wanted on it. I do like the format of the exam, the only thing is that (as far as I can tell) there is no partial credit for the questions. It was really hard studying for this exam; I just wanted it to be over with. But now I am going to get the grade that I wanted in this class, and it is over! Overall I enjoyed this class. It is definitly one of my favorite CS classes that I have taken so far. Downing really cares about the class and making it better, and I really appreciate that. It is not often that I have teachers so focused on the experience of the students. I learned a lot not only about C++ but also Java. The projects were great. They were just the right amount of difficulty. It also gave me some good experience working with a new partner for each project. I also liked that Downing would call on us in class; it forced me to pay attention. One thing is that the textbook for this course did not seem important to the lectures, so I gave up on reading it a couple weeks in. I continued to read the online readings though. I tried to take this class last semester, but I decided to drop it because I had ended up taking too many classes. I am glad that I decided to retake it this semester because it really was a good experience. I would definitly recommend this class to other CS students!
