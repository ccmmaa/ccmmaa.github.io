## What Did I Do This Week?

This week I have been focusing on my other classes and temporarily put OOP on the back burner. I also got sick in the middle of the week so I haven't been doing much in general except sleeping and trying to recoup.

## What Is In My Way?

My answer for this will probably be the same every week: time. I already have a lot of work piling up and getting sick did not help. This next week will be especially difficult as I have multiple projects and exams this week.

## What Will I Do Next Week?

Maybe start preparing for the exam that will be coming up. And of course do the reading and go to class.

## Class Experience So Far

Overall I'm enjoying it, but I wish the projects were more solid in a sense. It felt like the requirements for the last one kept changing. But I'm learning a lot and the lectures are very helpful. I am still a bit salty about Quiz 6 (i think?) being released after class on that Wednesday since I didn't actually have time to take it, but at least it will get dropped at the end of the semester.

## Tip of the Week
I realized this a couple of weeks ago but some of the machines in the CS labs have been replaced so you might want to check that your favorite machine is still there before trying to ssh into it!
