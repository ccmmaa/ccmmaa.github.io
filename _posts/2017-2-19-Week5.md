## What Did I Do This Week?

Finished up the Voting project! My partner and I were working on this up until the deadline, but thankfully we had everything working before we turned it in. I think I have a better hang of the workflow now. The one complaint I would have is that we have to copy over our issues from our personal private repo to the classroom repo, but I guess that's the way it goes.

## What Is In My Way?

Once again, it's time. Last week will probably be the worst of it, but I am still behind in some of my classes. Luckily though, I am not behind in OOP! My partner and I were cutting it pretty close though for the project.

## What Will I Do Next Week?

Focusing on catching up on the rest of my classes while also trying to not get behind in OOP, so of course that includes going to class and doing the reading.

## Class Experience So Far

Overall I'm still enjoying it. The projects are not too difficult or too easy, and I love learning about all the different uses that I hadn't even thought about for different types in C++ like const. I'm learning C++ is a very powerful and versatile language. With my current experience of the class, I would highly recommend it to my underclassmen.

## Tip of the Week
If you want to be able to use both Windows and Ubuntu on your desktop, you should think about dualbooting it. I did that with mine and I love it.
