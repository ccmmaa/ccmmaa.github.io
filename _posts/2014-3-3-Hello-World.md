## What Did I Do This Week?

It has been a busy week! On the tech side of things, I have gotten Docker and git onto both my Mac laptop and Ubuntu desktop and cloned the repo Professor Downing gave us for the class. I also received my OOp book in the mail a couple of days ago and read and highlighted the first two chapters that we are going to be quizzed on in class tomorrow (Hopefully the information sank in!)

## What Is In My Way?

Currently, I would say there are a lot of things in my way...The biggest thing would be my lack of knowledge of the many programs that we are planning on using in the class. I don't think I have had a class before where we were forced to use this many programs for the projects. But I'm sure this will be a good learning experience! The other thing would be my lack of knowlege of C++. I thought it would be a piece of cake, given that I already know and am familiar with C and Java but no dice! C++ in my opinion seems to be a completely different animal. Lastly, I would say that disconcerting platpus on the cover of the OOP book. I jest, but I do plan on covering the book. He's got a weird look in his eye... 

## What Will I Do Next Week?

Probably begin working on the first project! Also doing the reading and preparing for the quizzes every class...I probably need to work on learning C++ as well

## Class Experience So Far

The first day was a bit of a shock. Cold calling? Was not expecting that. It's nice not having to take notes on the code Downing writes in class, but I think I am going to take notes anyway to help me remember. Downing overall seems nice, and he genuinely wants to help us be good Computer Scientists. One thing I do have to complain about is the way quizzes can't be dropped if you weren't in class. Yes, it forces us to go to class, but if I'm sick and decide to stay home so that I don't infect the rest of the class I get penalized? Not a fan.

## Tip of the Week

This is a pretty lame tip but make sure that you put your resume on Piazza! Companies are constantly searching on there for interns and the pool there isn't as big as it is on LinkedIn

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
